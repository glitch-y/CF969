# CF969-Project
Repository for the CF969 Assignment

This repository contains the script for the CF969 Project. The project will look at how gold prices can be forecasted using a recurrent neural network algorithm 
such as LSTM. The deep learning model uses historical gold prices for 3 currencies: USD, GBP and EUR. Time series data spanning 22 years has been obtained and 
the goal is to compare the prediction prices against the actual data to see how close the model can predict the movement of gold prices.
